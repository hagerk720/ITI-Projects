#1-â€‹ Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them inreverse order with a space between them.

def set_get_name():
    first_name = input('Enter your first name:')
    last_name = input('Enter your last name:')
    print(last_name +' '+first_name)

#2- Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value ofn+nn+nnn.

def set_pattern():
    n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    nn = int(str(n) + str(n))
    nnn = int(str(n) + str(n) + str(n))
    result = n + nn + nnn
    print(result)

#3- Write a Python program to print the following here document.

def print_pattern_string():
    print("""a string that you "don't" have to escape
    This
    is a ....... multi-line
    heredoc string --------> example""")

#4- Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6.

def calculate_sphere_volume_radius_6():
    volume = 4/3 * 3.14 * 6.0**3
    print("the volume of the sphere is: ",volume)

#5- Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.

def calculate_triangle_area():
    base = float(input('Enter the base of triangle:'))
    height = float(input('Enter the height of triangle:'))
    area = 1/2 * base * height
    print("The area of the triangle is: ",area)

#6- Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

def draw_pattern():
    rows = 5
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(i+1):
            print("*", end=" ")

#7- Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.

def reverse_word():
    word = input('Enter the word you want to reverse:')
    reversed_word = ''.join(reversed(word))
    print(reversed_word)


#8- Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6

def nums_from_0_to_6():
    for i in range(6):
        if(i not in [3,6]):
            print(i)

# 9-Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50

def get_fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < 50:
        print(b, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a+b


# 10-Write a Python program that accepts a string and print how many digits an dnumbers
